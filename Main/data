 Developed an application that utilized a database

(Everything was done in Javascript/HTML/CSS)

o I was given a template that took care of setting up the database and provided an example of a few

webpages and some interaction between the server and the client

o My objective was to use this template to create a single page mobile app for a client. I used the template

to create my own functions required for the app (For example, a function that sends an e-mail with a link

to an e-mail, or another function that retrieves JSON data) and also to create any HTML/CSS required

for the client side of the app

o Was also provided with a wireframe to create the HTML/CSS behind the application

o Used Github to save files and heroku to show client app progress
