                <h4>JAVASCRIPT</h4>
                <p>JavaScript is my strongest language. I have used it extensively over the past 5 years using Libraries such as AngularJS, BootStrap, ArcGIS and many more. Most of my co-op terms have involved some form of internal or private web development and I have been constantly improving through side projects, course work and even this website</p>
